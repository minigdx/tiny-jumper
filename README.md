# Tiny Jumper

Tiny Jumper is a simple yet engaging game created as an example using the [**Tiny** game engine](https://minigdx.github.io/tiny/index.html). In this game, the hero jumps automatically, and the player's goal is to navigate upwards, striving to reach the top. The simplicity of the mechanics allows for quick play and a focus on precision timing and movement.

This project serves as a demonstration for the talk titled **"Crafting Cross-Platform Adventures: Building a Game Engine with Kotlin Multiplatform"**, presented at **DroidKaigi 2024** in Tokyo, Japan. 

Feel free to explore the code, and learn how Tiny powers this Tiny Jumper!
